# VectorFloorSeg Implementation Project

This project implements VectorFloorSeg, a deep learning system for semantic segmentation of vector roughcast floorplans using Two-Stream Graph Attention Networks.

## Project Overview

VectorFloorSeg processes SVG floorplans directly as vector graphics to produce clean, geometrically accurate room segmentation. Key features include:

- Dual Graph Representation: Primal graph (line segments) + Dual graph (regions)
- Modulated Graph Attention: Cross-stream attention mechanism
- Multi-task Learning: Joint boundary detection and room classification

## Implementation Phases

1.  Phase 1: Environment Setup and Dependencies
2.  Phase 2: Project Structure Setup and Pretrained Models
3.  Phase 3: Data Preparation Pipeline
4.  Phase 4: Model Implementation
5.  Phase 5: Training Script and Evaluation
